\begin{itemize}
	\item Limitations
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ignores application-level constraints
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Flow inter-dependency
					\item data placement and striping
					\item Deadlines
				\end{itemize}				
			\item Could design applications for DDC
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Not the focus of this paper; focus on showing feasibility rather than new designs
					\item better scheduling mechanisms
					\item better resource packing
					\item 
				\end{itemize}				
			\item Ignored failures, etc.
			\item mix of applications
		\end{itemize}		
	\item Research Challenges: looking ahead
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Designing low-latency networks
			\item Network abstractions for DDC?
			\item OS and system architecture
