\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we explored the feasibility of building networks for disaggregated datacenters. We find that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The fabric must provide 40Gbps bandwidth and $5\mu$s end-to-end latency.
\item Traffic workloads become more homogenous (spatially and temporally) and larger in volume.
\item State-of-the-art transport protocols can meet network-layer requirements without causing too much application-layer slowdown
\item Surprisingly, the scale of disaggregation has only a small effect on application performance.
\end{itemize}
Much work remains to be done regarding disaggregated datacenters. We have sought to inform this work with this study, which is the first known to us that seeks to explain the network requirements, traffic characteristics, and network-level constraints imposed by a disaggregated datacenter architecture.
